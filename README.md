#### Problem : Fresnel diffraction from an aperture – Simpson’s rule
- To experiment with Simpson’s rule for numerical integration.

Incident waves, travelling parallel to the z-axis, are diffracted by an aperture, and the scattering pattern observed on a screen. In the Fresnel approximation, the screen is near compared with the size of the aperture, and the diffraction pattern varies strongly with the separation, z. Examples of this “near-field” diffraction are shown in the figure for circular, square and triangular apertures.
